# HotelManagementSystem
# HotelManagementSystem This project is developed as part of my studies in the integrated preparatory program MI2. It is a hotel management application that includes both administration and reception functionalities. The goal is to streamline the management of reservations, guests, rooms, and staff through an intuitive and efficient interface.
